(** {1 Equivalence Classes} *)

(** An equivalence class is a set of terms that are currently equal
    in the partial model built by the solver.
    The class is represented by a collection of nodes, one of which is
    distinguished and is called the "representative".

    All information pertaining to the whole equivalence class is stored
    in this representative's node.

    When two classes become equal (are "merged"), one of the two
    representatives is picked as the representative of the new class.
    The new class contains the union of the two old classes' nodes.

    We also allow theories to store additional information in the
    representative. This information can be used when two classes are
    merged, to detect conflicts and solve equations Ã  la Shostak.
